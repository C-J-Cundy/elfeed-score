	Preparation for submission to MELPA.
	This commit prepares `elfeed-score' for submission to MELPA:

	    1. The naming scheme for public symbols changed from "elfeed-score/"
	       to "elfeed-score-" (in accordance with the Emacs Lisp Coding
	       Conventions. Aliases are defined for all 0.1 symbols.

	    2. Docstrings are now `checkdoc'-compliant.

	    3. Loading the package no longer affects Elfeed; the package
	       must be enabled via a call to `elfeed-score-enable', and may
	       be unloaded via `elfeed-score-unload' (again in accordance
	       with the Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions).

	    4. Miscellaneous other udpates (addition of a Package-Requires
	       header & and autoload, e.g.)
